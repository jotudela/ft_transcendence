# 🚀 INTRODUCTION

The `ft_transcendence` is the capstone of 42’s Common Core, challenging students to design a secure, full-stack web application from scratch.

It covers the entire development lifecycle—front-end, back-end, database management, real-time features, and security—using modern technologies and frameworks.

Beyond technical skills, the project emphasizes clean architecture, scalability, teamwork, and real-world software practices.

More than a technical milestone, `ft_transcendence` reflects the 42 ethos: innovation, self-learning, and readiness for the evolving tech landscape.

# 🛠️  Program Specificities and Considerations
---

## 🧠 BACKEND

- Framework: Built with `Fastify` and `Node.js`.
- Microservices: The backend is **modularized as microservices**, making it easy to scale and maintain.
- Database: Powered by `SQLite`, we have databse and its **API** in one container for better scalability and and maintain.
- API: Severals API for each container for each services, that expose database for frontend.
- Infra: It must build all the projet with one command and all microservice is launched in containers with `Docker`.

## 🖼️ FRONTEND

- Language: Built with `Typesrcipt` as base code.
- Framework: The hamonization of our project is built in `Tailwind CSS`.
- SPA: That part, ensure user experience, because the website doesn't refresh itself all the time, when click on button or others.
- Comptability: It must work with the latests version of your web browsers for example `Google`, `Mozila`, `Firefox` or `Safari`.
